# Leaderboard
The application tracks player points, which are awarded based on the points given to the players by the coach at the end of each match. The players are then ranked on the basis of these points which helps promote competitveness.

# Player Stat Management
The application enables the coach to keep track of player statistics such as height, weight, matches won, etc. The coach can now easily look up these statistics rather than having to go through the logbook/register he maintained before.

# Match Management
The application provides an in-built scorekeeper for the game of squash as well as an option for the coach to rate the player performances on various metrics and proivde comments. These scores and comments along with the match scoresheet are stored and are easily searchable. Not only does this help keep track of all the matches played by the players, but having the ability to view notes and scores associated to the games provides great insight to the progress the players are making.

# Performance Analysis
The application gives the coach basic graphical tools to get an idea of how the player performances have been over time. This allows easy visualization of progress over a long period of time. This first graphical tool allows the coach to view the wins and losses of the players as a pie chart.

The coach can also see a line chart which plots the ratings of the different criteria for each player against the match for which he recieved that rating. Again, this is a useful tool in assessing progress.
