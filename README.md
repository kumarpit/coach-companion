# SquAnalyze
This application was made for a squash coach to keep track of player performances and statistics. All player data is stored on a MySQL database and is used to provide insights to the coach.

# Leaderboard
The application tracks player points, which are awarded based on the points given to the players by the coach at the end of each match. The players are then ranked on the basis of these points which helps promote competitveness.

# Player Stat Management
The application enables the coach to keep track of player statistics such as height, weight, matches won, etc. The coach can now easily look up these statistics rather than having to go through the logbook/register he maintained before.
